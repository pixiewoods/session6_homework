In Angular folder ...
*  Added validation to portfolio's add portfolio form
*  Added styling to indicate valid vs invalid entries
*  Implemented ng-disabled on form submit button
*  Implemented ng-submit on form instead of ng-click on button

Plus ...
*  Implemented ng-pattern to apply a very simple date format checker to input
*  Added $setPristine statement following add of new portfolio.  Without it I was getting dirty state that caused form input validation error right after adding new portfolio.
